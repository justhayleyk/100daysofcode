# 100 Days of Code
R1: From June 1 to September 9, 2019, I am working on 100 days of code challenge. Over the next 100 days, I am going to work on honing my coding skills and share my progress and process. I am currently coding daily - but that is in the office and on work-related projects. In order to continue to develop my coding skills, I need to work on personal projects.

### Staying Accountable
In order to stay accountable for coding for a minimum of 1 hour a day on my coding projects I will implement a few techniques:
 - Adding a block of time to my calendar to ensure it is a non-negotiable.
 - Share a snippet of what I am working on, roadblocks, challenges, wins or what have you on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/justhayleyk/) Stories and save it as a highlight.
 - Post on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/JustHayleyK) articles I find, tips I learn and big wins to help others in their coding practice.

### What I define as a successful 100 days...
I define a success full #100DaysofCode Challenge where I have:
 - Coded on personal projects for 100 days straight.
 - Developed new coding skills.
 - Honed my existing coding abilities.
 - Have 1 fully fleshed out project by the end.
